### Terraform

I didn't get the chance to turn this into a true module but at least what I read from the requirements it should cover all the bases.

The two required TF_VARS are:
 - "username" - "This is the username you want to create with the terraform automation."
 - "role_group_name" - "This is the role/group/policy-names for the prod user."
